# ImmutableObjects Project

This project demonstrates the use of immutable objects and value types in C#.

## Overview

The main example is the `Fraction` class, which represents an immutable rational number. Once created, its state cannot be changed. All operations return new instances, ensuring thread safety and predictability.

## Key Concepts

- **Immutability**: Objects whose state cannot be modified after creation.
- **Value Semantics**: Equality and operations are based on values, not references.

## Example

The `Fraction` class provides arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and conversion methods, always returning new immutable objects.

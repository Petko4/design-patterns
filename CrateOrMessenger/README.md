# CrateOrMessenger Project

This project demonstrates the Crate/Messenger design pattern in C#.

## What is the Crate/Messenger Pattern?

The Crate/Messenger pattern is a design pattern where a simple data-carrying object (the "Crate" or "Messenger") is used to transfer a group of related values together. This object typically contains only fields or properties and minimal or no business logic. Its main purpose is to encapsulate and transport data between different parts of an application, often between layers or components. In C#, such objects are commonly known as DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) or POCOs (Plain Old CLR Objects).

## Example in This Project

The `Task` class inside `DailyPlan.cs` serves as an example of the Crate/Messenger pattern. It is used to carry information about scheduled tasks (start time, end time, description) within the daily plan.

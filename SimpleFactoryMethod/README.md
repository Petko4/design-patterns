# SimpleFactoryMethod Project

This project demonstrates the Simple Factory Method design pattern in C#.

## What is the Simple Factory Method Pattern?

The Simple Factory Method is a creational design pattern that encapsulates the creation logic of objects. It provides a static method to create instances of different classes based on input parameters, promoting loose coupling and easier maintenance.

## Example in This Project

The project contains an abstract class `APerson` and a factory method that creates different types of people based on provided arguments. This demonstrates how to centralize object creation logic.
